# Informal Settlement Mapping
This is a tool I built to identify informal settlements in urban areas using machine learning as part of a collaboration between the Rhodes Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL) and the World Food Programme (WFP). It uses multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and OpenStreetMap data as inputs. Classification is currently carried out using a Random Forest algorithm.
